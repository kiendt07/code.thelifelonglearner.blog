Without much curation and editing, here is a collection of notes and readings about Semantic Web and Linked Data. The majority are copied verbatim and linked to their original sources. A small minority are in my own words, which start with “KD”.

For context, I was researching about Knowledge Graph for my bachelor thesis, collecting knowledge to understand the topic. You can [email me](mailto:kienbroc@gmail.com) with questions, additions, or find me lurking on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/kgao) too much these days.

## On Semantic Web introduction

There’s already great introduction content out there so I just put some of them here. Actually Semantic Web, Linked Data and Knowledge Graph are really similar terms, for now let’s just think they are the same.

If you have CS background but are completely new about Semantic Web, follow these links:

* Semantic Web introduction ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zteyEk9LADs)) with real use cases, covers both RDF and OWL (best one I’ve seen so far).
* Visual explanation ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zteyEk9LADs)). Love this one. The author is ex-chairman of W3C.
* A TED talk from the creator himself Tim Berners-Lee ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo)). As you might know already, he is also the creator of WWW and HTTP, which means he’s really big.

## More

* \[KD] RDF is a common data format for storing knowledge graph. If you download a small part of the semantic web, it could be in RDF format.
* The biggest difference between Property Graphs do not have a schema. Knowledge Graphs have very rich and standardized schema.
* \[KD] My favorite comparison between RDF and Property Graph (eg: Neo4j).
